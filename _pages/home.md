### Welcome!

Iâ€™m a PhD student at the University of Auckland at the School of Biological Sciences. My research interests are in the realm of theoretical biology. What I do is use computational models to understand how biological evolution works. Specifically, I research the evolution of multicellular complexity. One of my areas of research is on the evolution of morphogenesis, or organism shape. I want to know how organisms transition from simple balls of cells to complex forms, and what processes are important for that transition. Below, I am showing you an image of some organisms that have evolved morphogenesis through computational simulation.

I also research the evolution of germ-soma separation, cell-specialisation and stem-cell-systems.

### About me

I am a theoretical biologist, using computational methods to explore evolutionary dynamics.
